* [vtreat: a data.frame Processor for Predictive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09477.pdf); Nina Zumel, John Mount; vtreat prepares real-world data for predictive modeling in a reproducible and statistically sound manner, and is a valuable addition to the data science work-flow. Missing or invalid values are replaced with safe valid values, and further indicated by additional dummy variables. Categorical variables are represented in a manner that is robust to the appearance of novel levels during model application. Estimated variable significances are supplied for user-controlled variable pruning.

### 2016

* [Entity Embeddings of Categorical Variables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06737.pdf); Cheng Guo and Felix Berkhahn; We map categorical variables in a function approximation problem into Euclidean spaces, which are the entity embeddings of the categorical variables. ... As entity embedding defines a distance measure for categorical variables it can be used for visualizing categorical data and for data clustering.

* [embed: Extra Recipes for Encoding Categorical Predictors](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/embed/index.html); 	Max Kuhn; Factor predictors can be converted to one or more numeric representations using simple generalized linear models <arXiv:1611.09477> or nonlinear models <arXiv:1604.06737>. All encoding methods are supervised.
